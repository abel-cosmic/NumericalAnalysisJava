# Numerical Analysis Programming Assignment

This repository contains Java programs developed by the students of Hope Enterprise University College, Department of Computer Science, for the Numerical Analysis programming assignment. Each student in a group of not more than 4 students implemented at least one problem. The submission date for this assignment is January 12, 2024.

## Group Information
- **Group Name:** NumericalWizards
- **Group Members:**
  1. Abel Shibabaw RCS/291/21
  2. Dagim Tesfaye RCS/300/21
  3. Mohammed Ibrahim RCS/2013/22

## Problems and Implementations

### Problem 1: Matrix Product
**File:** `ExampleCodeToGenerateMatrix.java`

Description: This Java program accepts two matrices and displays their product.

### Problem 2: Interpolation using Divided Difference Formula
**File:** `NewtonInterpolation.java`

Description: This Java program implements interpolation using the divided difference formula. It displays the divided difference table and the corresponding equation.

### Problem 3: Determinant of a Square Matrix
**File:** `MatrixDeterminant.java`

Description: This Java program finds the determinant of a square matrix of any row and column size.

### Problem 4: System of Linear Equations using Cramer's Rule
**File:** `CreamersRuleSolver.java`

Description: This Java program solves a system of linear equations using Cramer's rule. It applies concepts of object-oriented programming and includes a GUI for user interaction.

## Instructions for Running the Programs

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files.
4. Compile the Java files using the following command:

   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   ```

Replace `FileName` with the actual name of the Java file.

5. Run the compiled program using:

   ```bash
   java FileName
   ```

   Replace `FileName` with the actual name of the compiled Java file (without the `.class` extension).

## Notes
- Each Java file corresponds to one of the assigned problems.
- Ensure that the input matrices, data points, or linear equations are provided as per the program's requirements.
- Follow the program's prompts or GUI for interaction.

Feel free to explore and run each program to observe the solutions developed by the students. If you have any questions or issues, please contact the group members or the instructor.
